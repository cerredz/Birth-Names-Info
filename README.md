# Birth Names Info 👶 

Birth Names info is a full-stack application that takes in a name input from the user and returns an abundance of data relating to that name, all derived from a Kaggle CSV file containing millions of data parameters. Some information you can expect to find are similiar names, peak popularity of that name, most popular decade, and more. This project's main purpose was to familiarize myself and gain experience using GraphQL, and I utilized a M.E.R.N Stack
